	    That's an iFly Airlines sponsored movie. It's a suspense-hardboiled-action-romance-horror-comedy movie. Have you heard about the murder? (Please grow up...)

	    After spending half a year by your side… My feelings for you… They changed. (.......What is wrong with these two women!? Why does my pain give them delight?) 'Shichishito'. The treasured Kurain Village heirloom whose name means '7 Branched Sword'. It is said that this sacred sword represents life itself. Though the branches may appear infinite, the choices limitless... like our destinies, the sword comes to but one end. One merciless point. And when the silver cord, the fragile thread that binds us to this world, is severed... the illusion is revealed and the implacability of fate is finally laid bare.

	    (It's not a bad feeling, exposing contradictions like this. Now I understand that happy look on Wright's face every time he does it...) Sometimes Life Just sucks Well then, consider the mission a successful one.

	    Yeah, this guy was so bad, he couldn't even fold a dollar, let alone a crane. Everyone tried to comfort him, but he would just sit there sobbing. The Steel Samurai is the lead character in a popular kid's show. He walks the streets of Neo Olde Tokyo... Fighting battle after battle against the Evil Magistrate and his minions. Of course, he never really defeats the Evil Magistrate. Although... I guess he did defeat him this time... H-hold on just a moment! Where's the witness? I’m so jealous of Mystic Maya! Ah, what a wonderful relationship… Long time no see, Nick. A lawyer is someone who smiles no matter how bad it gets.

	    You fail to grasp the concept of 'shooting people is bad', detective. How else would you get in?! Teleportation?! Alaka.....alaka......ALAKAZOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMG

	    Ah, a ladder. Maybe Edgeworth took his unholy revenge on the detectives and slapped somebody! Ah that's right. I was in the middle of recreating a chess game. (What is this, some kind of secret courtroom poker ring?)
